## Abstract
In the Philippines, tons of garbage is generated every single day and are steadily increasing every year. This paper aims to use artificial intelligence to create a model to classify different types of garbage using convolutional neural network. The data from Kaggle contains metal, paper, cardboard, trash, glass, and plastic. The authors added sachet because it is one of the most common types of garbage in the Philippines. The baseline to beat is 21% which is 1.25 x PCC and also 77% from the submission in Kaggle. The Xception model, a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), was used as a base for the classifier model. The resulting accuracy was 83% which outperformed the baseline. This can help automate waste segregation facilities in the country. The results could further be improved by adding more data for each class and be more representative by adding more classes of wastes.
